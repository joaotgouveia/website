title: "GSoC 2024: Midterm Updates For MankalaEngine"
description: |
    Over the past few weeks, I've made significant progress in developing
    MankalaEngine. While there's still room for improvement, I've now created
    a library that enables the creation of opponents in Mancala games.

## Design Considerations

One of the main focuses while designing this engine was flexibility, to ensure
the library is usable for almost all Mancala variants. While certain abstractions
are necessary to achieve this goal, it's also important not to overly abstract
the library.

## Provided Functionality

MankalaEngine provides classes to assist in creating computerized opponents for
any Mancala variant. As mentioned earlier, these classes are designed with a
degree of abstraction to allow for greater flexibility on the developer's end. In
addition to these base classes, a concrete implementation tailored for the
Bohnenspiel [\[1\]](#citeproc_bib_item_1) variant is also provided.

## The `Board` struct

The `board` struct is the base struct for any Mancala variant's board. It is used
to specify the structure of the board used by a variant. As of now, this struct
allows for a board with an arbitrary number of holes and two stores, one per
player, as this seems to be the case for most Mancala games.

## The `Rules` class

The `rules` class is the base class for the rules of a Mancala variant. It is
used to specify the behaviour when making a move, what constitutes a valid move,
when the game is over, etc. The only rule assumed to be shared by all variants is
that the winning player is the one with more pebbles in their store, as this
seems to be relatively common in Mancala variants.

## The `moveselection` functions

The functions provided in the `moveselection` file are general adversarial search
functions that can be used to select moves for Mancala games. In addition to
Minimax and MTDF-f [\[2\]](#citeproc_bib_item_2), random selection and user
selection functions are also provided.

## The `MankalaEngine` class

The `MankalaEngine` class ties everything together. When instatiating it, you'll
need to choose a move selection function. It then provides a function, `play`,
that, given the player whose turn it is to play, the rules to use, and the board
in which the move will be played, executes the move selected by its move
selection function. This allows reusing the common structure of a play across all
Mancala variants while deferring variant-specific behaviour to the rules object.

```cpp
bool MankalaEngine::play(Player player, const Rules& rules,
                         Board& state) const {
    if (rules.gameOver(player, state)) {
        const Player winner = player == player_1 ? player_2 : player_1;
        rules.finishGame(winner, state);
        return false;
    }
    const int move = _selectMove(player, rules, state);
    rules.move(move, player, state);
    return true;
}
```

## Next steps

The idea is to continue adding concrete variant implementations to the library so
that developers wanting to create a Mancala game don't have to implement them
themselves. Additionally, adding the option to choose the difficulty of an
opponent is also relevant. This may be implemented, for example, by allowing
changes to the cutoff depth for the Minimax and MTD-f opponents, which is not
currently supported.

Another possible route is developing a Qt application for playing Mancala that
uses this engine. This would likely help generate interest in the project within
the broader community.
